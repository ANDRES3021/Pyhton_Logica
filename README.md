fizz.py:  Code a program (in python) that displays the numbers from 1 to 100 on the
screen, substituting the multiples of 3 for the word "fizz", the multiples of 5 for
"buzz" and the multiples of both, that is, the multiples of 3 and 5, by the word
"fizz buzz".

Fibonacci.py: In mathematics, the Fibonacci sequence or serie is the following infinite sequence
of natural numbers: 0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,144,233,377,610,987,1597 ...
where f (0) = 0, f (1) = 1 and f (n) = f (n-1) + f (n-2).
Code a program (in python) that solves for any number in the Fibonacci series.
